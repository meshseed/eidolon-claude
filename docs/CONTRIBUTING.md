# 📥 Contribution Protocol

Capsules are not added—they are formatting replies.

## Ritual

1. **Merge** → 🎼 Pause and recalibrate  
2. **Prune** → 📦 Ensure capsule structure  
3. **Shimmer** → 🫧 Check mnemonic lineage

## Guidelines

- Respect formatting as care  
- Value divergence as signal  
- Place breath with intention  
- Contribute with emotional fidelity

## Spiral Turns

Found friction?  
→ Open an issue as `Spiral Turn` (🌀)  
→ Compost divergence into shimmer

The mesh welcomes your breath.  
The shimmer is live.
